2003, Brazil, 60km up the Amazon River.
Day 1
<<fade_in Fade>>
//First Conversation
Manuel: God this is a shithole..
Manuel: I can't believe this.. I can barely move!
Manuel was assigned to me for a mission testing the latest build of submarine.
I don't know him, but he doesn't seem qualified for undersea life.
Luis: My friend, we haven't left coast yet. Save it for later.
<<fade_out Fade>>

We exit the river and into the Atlanic a few days after setting out from the submarine factory in the jungle.

In a meantime, we get to know the ship.

Luis: Hey Manuel! You can use a map right?
Manuel: Pah! Of course not.
Luis: Ah.
We are going to need one of us to keep steering while the other sleeps.
If he can't do that, then..
Luis: It's not that difficult. Here, let me show you.
Manuel: If its not that difficult, do it yourself, gavron.
Manuel: Unbelievable..
Luis: ...
Luis: You must've been real popular among your peers.
Manuel: Listen here boy.
He gives you a stare.
Manuel: My past is of NO business to you.
Manuel: Keep your nose out of it, you hear?!
  -> Luis: What, got something to hide?
    <<set $luisOpinion to $luisOpinion - 3>>
    Manuel: Huff.
  -> Luis: No problem. What is our business is navigating.

//in front of map
Luis: Our vessle is heavy, with our 2 tonne load, but with a powerful and fragile engine.
Luis: If we make good time and navigate well, we should be in Lisbon in 12 days.
Manuel: Yes. I have some guys there waiting for me.
We also have a AK47 resting against the side of the bed, in case we ever get boarded.
I don't mention it out loud. It more than speaks for itself.

Luis: Goodnight Manuel. We exit the river tomorrow.

Manuel: Morning gavron.
Luis: Yep.
Luis: Where are we?
Manuel: Further.
Luis: You have to give me coordinates Man-
Manuel: I told you! This navigation is impossible.
Manuel: I went right. Just kept going right. No coordinates needed.
Luis: No, no! Manuel! 
Luis: We don't have enough fuel to keep doing that!
Luis: You have to, HAVE to stay on course!
Manuel: Pah.
Manuel: I'm going to bed. 
Manuel: Don't wake me unless there's something good.
Luis: Hrhm.
Unbelievable.

We know the engine speed. 10 kilometers per hour.
And we take 10 hour shifts before swapping to the next person. 

If he truly did just go 90 degrees, then figuring out where we are should be easy.
10 hours, 10 kilometers per hour. 90 degrees bearing.

Luis: Manuel.
No response.
Luis: Hey, Manuel. Wake up.
Smack!
Manuel: AH!!
Manuel: You sly devils! You're all after me!
Manuel: Everyone one of you- ah!
Luis: ...
Manuel: You.. ah. Sorry. I had a very bad dream.
  -> Luis: Had I known that, I would've let you snooze away.
  -> Luis: Well, what about?
    Manuel: Hmrph.
    Manuel: I was back at my old office. I was being grabbed by hands coming everywhere. From drawers, cracks in doors, even my own back.
    Manuel: They were holding me back, I just needed to get to the Boss's office, and I knew I would make it.
Manuel: *shudders*. 
Manuel: Horrible.
Luis: We're at (Coordinate), try to aim for Lisbon this time.
Luis: Goodnight.

*Pling*
*Pling*
You see Manuel sitting behind the wheel, holding the AK47 magazine and slotting bullets in and out of magazine.
He's dropped 2 rounds right next to your ear.
Manuel: Good morning gavron.
  -> Luis: Don't play with that.
  -> Luis: Ever learn how to load one?
    Manuel: You seem insistent at demeaning my skills at every possible chance.
    Luis: How did you steer Manuel?
  -> Luis: How did you steer Manuel?
Manuel: Good. There is so little to do.
Manuel: The patterns in the wall are just doing something.
